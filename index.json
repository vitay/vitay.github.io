The transformation of the underlying simulated neuronal activity of these models to simulated non-invasive measurements, such as BOLD signals, is particularly relevant. The present work describes the implementation of a BOLD monitor within the neural simulator ANNarchy to allow an on-line computation of simulated BOLD signals from neural network models. An active research topic regarding the simulation of BOLD signals is the coupling of neural processes to cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). The flexibility of ANNarchy allows users to define this coupling with a high degree of freedom and thus, not only allows to relate mesoscopic network models of populations of spiking neurons to experimental BOLD data, but also to investigate different hypotheses regarding the coupling between neural processes, CBF and CMRO2 with these models. In this study, we demonstrate how simulated BOLD signals can be obtained from a network model consisting of multiple spiking neuron populations. We first demonstrate the use of the Balloon model, the predominant model for simulating BOLD signals, as well as the possibility of using novel user-defined models, such as a variant of the Balloon model with separately driven CBF and CMRO2 signals. We emphasize how different hypotheses about the coupling between neural processes, CBF and CMRO2 can be implemented and how these different couplings affect the simulated BOLD signals. With the BOLD monitor presented here, ANNarchy provides a tool for modelers who want to relate their network models to experimental MRI data and for scientists who want to extend their studies of the coupling between neural processes and the BOLD signal by using modeling approaches. This facilitates the investigation and model-based analysis of experimental BOLD data and thus improves multi-scale understanding of neural processes in humans.","tags":["ANNarchy"],"title":"BOLD monitoring in the neural simulator ANNarchy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carolin Scholl","Javier Baladron","Julien Vitay","Fred Hamker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1643896672,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643896672,"objectID":"e39275741214aa569c41667f1215d8cc","permalink":"https://julien-vitay.net/publication/scholl2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-03T14:57:52+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/scholl2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Devaluation protocols reveal that Tourette patients show an increased propensity to habitual behaviors as they continue to respond to devalued outcomes in a cognitive stimulus-response-outcome association task. We use a neuro-computational model of hierarchically organized cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops to shed more light on habit formation and its alteration in Tourette patients. In our model, habitual behavior emerges from cortico-thalamic shortcut connections, where enhanced habit formation can be linked to faster plasticity in the shortcut or to a stronger feedback from the shortcut to the basal ganglia. We explore two major hypotheses of Tourette pathophysiology—local striatal disinhibition and increased dopaminergic modulation of striatal medium spiny neurons—as causes for altered shortcut activation. Both model changes altered shortcut functioning and resulted in higher rates of responses towards devalued outcomes, similar to what is observed in Tourette patients.

Recent work indicates that CNNs trained on ImageNet are biased towards features that encode textures and that these alone are sufficient to generalize to unseen test data from the same distribution as the training data but often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data. It has been shown that augmenting the training data with different image styles decreases this texture bias in favor of increased shape bias while at the same time improving robustness to common corruptions, such as noise and blur. Commonly, this is interpreted as shape bias increasing corruption robustness. However, this relationship is only hypothesized. We perform a systematic study of different ways of composing inputs based on natural images, explicit edge information, and stylization. While stylization is essential for achieving high corruption robustness, we do not find a clear correlation between shape bias and robustness. We conclude that the data augmentation caused by style-variation  accounts for the improved corruption robustness and increased shape bias is only a byproduct.","tags":[],"title":"Does enhanced shape bias improve neural network robustness to common corruptions?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Neuro-computational models are different from classical neural networks (deep learning) in many aspects:\n The complexity of the neurons, whose activity is governed by one or several differential equations instead of a simple weighted sum. The complexity and diversity of the learning rules (synaptic plasticity), compared to gradient descent. The size of the networks needed to simulate significant parts of the brain. The huge diversity of models, architectures, frameworks used by researchers in computational neuroscience.  The increasing size of such networks asks for efficient parallel simulations, using distributed systems (OpenMP, MPI) or GPUs (CUDA). However, computational neuroscientists cannot be expected to be also experts in parallel computing. There is a need for a general-purpose neuro-simulator, with an easy but flexible interface allowing to define a huge variety of models, but which is internally efficient and allows for fast parallel simulations on various hardwares.\nOver many years, we have developed ANNarchy (Artificial Neural Networks architect), a parallel simulator for distributed rate-coded or spiking neural networks. The definition of the models is made in Python, but the library generates optimized C++ code to actually run the simulation on parallel hardware, using either openMP or CUDA. The current stable version is 4.6 and is released under the GNU GPL v2 or later.\nThe code is available at:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/annarchy/annarchy\nThe documentation is available at:\nhttps://annarchy.readthedocs.org\nCore principles ANNarchy separates the description of a neural network from its simulation. The description is declared in a Python script, offering high flexibility and readability of the code, and allowing to use the huge ecosystem of scientific libraries available with Python (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib\u0026hellip;). Using Python furthermore reduces the programming effort to a minimum, letting the modeller concentrate on network design and data analysis.\nA neural network is defined as a collection of interconnected populations of neurons. Each population comprises a set of similar artificial neurons (rate-coded or spiking point-neurons), whose activity is ruled by one or many ordinary differential equations. The activity of a neuron depends on the activity of other neurons through synapses, whose strength can evolve with time depending on pre- or post-synaptic activities (synaptic plasticity). Populations are interconnected with each other through projections, which contain synapses between two populations.\nANNarchy provides a set of classical neuron or synapse models, but also allows the definition of specific models. The ordinary differential equations (ODE) governing neural or synaptic dynamics have to be specified by the modeler. Contrary to other simulators (except Brian) which require to code these modules in a low-level language, ANNarchy provides a mathematical equation parser which can generate optimized C++ code depending on the chosen parallel framework. Bindings from C++ to Python are generated thanks to Cython (C-extensions to Python), which is a static compiler for Python. These bindings allow the Python script to access all data generated by the simulation (neuronal activity, connection weights) as if they were simple Python attributes. However, the simulation itself is independent from Python and its relatively low performance.\nExample of a pulse-coupled network of Izhikevich neurons To demonstrate the simplicity of ANNarchy\u0026rsquo;s interface, let\u0026rsquo;s focus on the \u0026ldquo;Hello, World!\u0026rdquo; of spiking networks: the pulse-coupled network of Izhikevich neurons (Izhikevich, 2003).

In our experiments on the Kitti object detection dataset we show that our model is able to learn to estimate objects' 3D position from a monocular camera image alone without having any explicit geometric model or other prior information on how to perform the transformation. While performing slightly worse than networks which are purpose-built for this task, our approach allows feeding the same bird's-eye view object detection network with input data from different sensor modalities.

A dropout layer with p=0.2 is added after the max-pooling. After 4 such convolutional blocks with increasing numbers of features (32, 64, 126 and 256), the last tensor (6x6x256) is flattened into a vector of 9216 elements and projected on a fully connected layer of 500 neurons. The output layer has 12 neurons using the sigmoid activation function, each representing one of the 12 AUs present in the combined dataset.

The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) released by neurons in these two small areas exerts a strong influence on neural excitability and plasticity in many brain areas: mostly the basal ganglia (BG), but also the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus or the amygdala.\nA striking feature of VTA cells is their response during classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning, as observed by Schultz et al (1998). Early on, VTA cells respond phasically (a burst) to unconditioned stimuli (US, or rewards in operant conditioning). Gradually during learning, the amplitude of this response decreases, replaced by a response to the conditioned stimuli (CS) which are predictive of reward delivery. Moreover, if a reward is predicted by the CS but omitted, VTA cells show a brief depression of activity (a dip) at the time where the US was expected. This pattern resembles the temporal difference (TD) error signal used in reinforcement learning, what generated multitudes of models based on that analogy.\nWhat remains unclear is how VTA cells access information about the US, the CS and more importantly the time elapsed since CS onset. The goal of this research project is to investigate the mechanisms by which VTA is able to exhibit these properties, by looking at the afferent system to VTA.

This post is intended to explain the main difference between SR and model-free / model-based RL algorithms and to point out its usefulness to understand goal-directed behavior.\nTable of Contents  1 - Motivation  1.1 - Model-free vs. model-based RL 1.2 - Goal-directed behavior vs. habits   2 - Successor representations in reinforcement learning  2.1 - Main idea 2.2 - Linear function approximation 2.3 - Successor representations of actions   3 - Successor representations in neuroscience  3.1 - Human goal-directed behavior 3.2 - Neural substrates of successor representations   Discussion References   1 - Motivation 1.1 - Model-free vs. model-based RL There are two main families of reinforcement learning (RL; Sutton and Barto, 2017) algorithms:\n Model-free (MF) methods estimate the value of a state $V^\\pi(s)$ or of a state-action pair $Q^\\pi(s, a)$ by sampling trajectories and averaging the obtained returns (Monte-Carlo control), or by estimating the Bellman equations (Temporal difference - TD):   $$V^\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [\\sum_{k=0} \\gamma^k \\, r_{t+k+1} | s_t = s] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\, V^\\pi(s_{t+1}) | s_t = s]$$   $$Q^\\pi(s, a) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [\\sum_{k=0} \\gamma^k \\, r_{t+k+1} | s_t = s, a_t = a] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\, Q^\\pi(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) | s_t = s, a_t = a]$$   Model-based (MB) methods use (or learn) a model of the environment - transition probabilities $p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$ and reward probabilities $r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$ - and use it to plan trajectories maximizing the theoretical return, either through some form of forward planning (search tree) or using dynamic programming (solving the Bellman equations directly).   $$\\pi^* = \\text{argmax}_{\\pi} \\; p(s_0) \\, \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t \\, p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) \\, \\pi(s_t, a_t) \\, r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$$   $$V^*(s) = \\max_a \\sum_{s'} p(s' | s, a) \\, (r(s_t, a, s')+ \\gamma \\, V^*(s'))$$  The main advantage of model-free methods is their speed: they cache the future of the system into value functions. When having to take a decision at time $t$, we only need to look at the action with the highest Q-value in the state $s_t$ and take it. If the Q-values are optimal, this is the optimal policy. Oppositely, model-based algorithms have to plan sequentially in the state-action space, which can be very long if the problem has a long temporal horizon.\nThe main drawback of MF methods is their inflexibility when the reward distribution changes. When the reward associated with a transition changes (the source of reward has vanished, its nature has changed, the rules of the game have changed, etc), each action leading to that transition has to be experienced multiple times before the corresponding values reflect that change. This is due to the use of the temporal difference (TD) algorithm, where the reward prediction error (RPE) is used to update values:\n$$\\delta_t = r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\, V^\\pi(s_{t+1}) - V^\\pi(s_t)$$ $$\\Delta V^\\pi(s_t) = \\alpha \\, \\delta_t$$ When the reward associated to a transition changes drastically, only the last state (or action) is updated after that experience (unless we use eligibility traces). Only multiple repetitions of the same trajectory would allow changing the initial decisions. This is opposite to MB methods, where a change in the reward distribution would very quickly influence the planning of the optimal trajectory. In MB, the reward probabilities can be estimated with:\n$$ \\Delta r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) = \\alpha \\, (r_{t+1} - r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})) $$  with $r_{t+1}$ being the reward obtained during one sampled transition. The transition probabilities can also be learned from experience using:\n$$ \\Delta p(s' | s_t, a_t) = \\alpha \\, (\\mathbb{I}(s_{t+1} = s') - p(s' | s_t, a_t)) $$  where $\\mathbb{I}(b)$ is 1 when $b$ is true, 0 otherwise. Depending on the learning rate, changes in the environment dynamics can be very quickly learned by MB methods, as updates do not depend on other estimates (there is no bootstrapping contrary to TD).\n1.2 - Goal-directed behavior vs. habits The model-free RPE has become a very influential model of dopaminergic (DA) activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). At the beginning of classical Pavlovian conditioning, DA cells react phasically to unconditioned stimuli (US, rewards). After enough conditioning trials, DA cells only react to conditioned stimuli (CS), i.e. stimuli which predict the delivery of a reward. Moreover, if the reward is omitted, DA cells exhibit a pause in firing. This pattern of activation corresponds to the RPE: DA cells respond to unexpected reward events, either positively when more reward than expected is received, or negatively when less reward is delivered. The simplicity of this model has made RPE a successful model of DA activity (but see Vitay and Hamker, 2014 for a more detailed model).\nA similar but not identical functional dichotomy as MF/MB opposes deliberative goal-directed behavior and inflexible stimulus-response associations called habits (Dickinson and Balleine, 2002). Goal-directed behavior is sensitive to reward devaluation: if an outcome was previously rewarding but ceases to be (for example, a poisonous product is injected into some food reward, even outside the conditioning phase), goal-directed behavior would quickly learn to avoid that outcome, while habitual behavior will continue to seek for it. Over-training can transform goal-directed behavior into habits (Corbit and Balleine, 2011). Habits are usually considered as a model-free learning behavior, while goal-directed behavior implies the use of a world model. The dual system theory discusses the arbitration mechanisms necessary to coordinate these two learning frameworks (Lee, Shimojo and O\u0026rsquo;Doherty, 2014).\nBoth forms of behavior are thought to happen concurrently in the brain, with model-based / goal-directed behavior classically assigned to the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus and model-free / habitual behavior mapped to the ventral basal ganglia and the dopaminergic system. However, recent results and theories suggest that these two functional systems are largely overlapping and that even dopamine firing might reflect model-based processes (Doll, Simon and Daw, 2012; Miller et al., 2018). It is yet to be understood how these two extreme mechanisms of the RL spectrum might coexist in the brain and be coordinated: successor representations might provide us with additional useful insights into the functioning of the brain.\n2 - Successor representations in reinforcement learning 2.1 - Main idea The original formulation of successor representations (SR) is actually not recent (Dayan, 1993), but it is subject to a revival since a couple of years with the work of Samuel J. Gershman (e.g. Gershman et al., 2012, 2018, Momennejad et al., 2017, Stachenfeld et al., 2017, Gardner et al, 2018).\nThe SR algorithm learns two quantities:\n The expected immediate reward received after each state:  $$ r(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [r_{t+1} | s_t = s] $$  The expected discounted future state occupancy (the SR itself):  $$ M(s, s') = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma^k \\, \\mathbb{I}(s_{t+k+1} = s') | s_t = s] $$  I omit here the dependency of $r$ and $M$ on the policy itself in the notation, but it is of course implicitly there.\nThe SR represents the fact that a state $s'$ can be reached after $s$, with a value decreasing with the temporal gap between the two states: states occurring in rapid succession will have a high SR, very distant states will have a low SR. If $s'$ happens consistently before $s$, the SR should be 0 (causality principle). This is in principle similar to model-based RL, but without an explicit representation of the transition structure: it only represents how states are temporally correlated, not which action leads to which state.\nThe value of a state $s$ is then defined by:\n$$ V^\\pi(s) = \\sum_{s'} M(s, s') \\, r(s') $$  The value of a state $s$ depends on which states $s'$ can be visited after it (following the current policy, implicitly), how far in the future they will happen (discount factor in $M(s, s')$) and how much reward can be obtained immediately in those states ($r(s')$). Note that it is merely a rewriting of the definition of the value of a state, with rewards explicitly separated from state visitation and time replaced by succession probabilities:\n$$V^\\pi(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [\\sum_{k=0} \\gamma^k \\, r_{t+k+1}] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [\\sum_{k=0} r(s_{t+k+1}) \\times (\\gamma^k \\, \\mathbb{I}(s_{t+k+1}))]$$ The SR also obeys a recursive relationship similar to the Bellman equation, as it is based on a discounted sum:\n$$ M(s_t, s') = \\mathbb{I}(s_t = s') + \\gamma \\, M(s_{t+1}, s') $$  The discounted probability of arriving in $s'$ after being in $s_t$ is one if we are already in $s'$, and gamma times the discounted probability of arriving in $s'$ after being in the next state $s_{t+1}$ otherwise.\nThis recursive relationship implies that we are going to be able to estimate the SR $M(s, s')$ using a sensory prediction error (SPE) similar to the TD RPE (Gershman et al., 2012):\n$$ \\delta^\\text{SR}_t = \\mathbb{I}(s_t = s') + \\gamma \\, M(s_{t+1}, s') - M(s_t, s') $$   $$ \\Delta M(s_t, s') = \\alpha \\, \\delta^\\text{SR}_t $$  The SPE states that the expected occupancy for states that are visited more frequently than expected (positive sensory prediction error) should be increased, while the expected occupancy for states that are visited less frequently than expected (negative sensory prediction error) should be decreased. In short: is arriving in this new state surprising? It should be noted that the SPE is defined over all possible successor states $s'$, so the SPE is actually a vector.\nWe can already observe that SR is a trade-off between MF and MB methods. A change in the reward distribution can be quickly tracked by SR algorithms, as the immediate reward $r(s)$ can be updated with:\n$$ \\Delta r(s) = \\alpha \\, (r_{t+1} - r(s)) $$ However, the SR $M(s, s')$ uses other estimates for its update (bootstrapping), so changes in the transition structure may take more time to propagate to all state-state discounted occupancies (Gershman, 2018).\n2.2 - Linear function approximation Before looking at the biological plausibility of this algorithm, we need to deal with the curse of dimensionality. The SR $M(s, s')$ is a matrix associating each state of the system to all other states (size $|\\mathcal{S}| \\times |\\mathcal{S}|$). This is of course impracticable for most problems and we need to rely on function approximation. The simplest solution is to represent each state $s$ by a set of $d$ features $[f_i(s)]_{i=1}^d$. Each feature can for example be the presence of an object in the scene, some encoding of the position of the agent in the world, etc. The SR for a state $s$ only needs to predict the expected discounted probability that a feature $f_j$ will be observed in the future, not the complete state representation. This should ensure generalization across states, as only the presence of relevant features is needed. The SR can be linearly approximated by:\n$$ M_j(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^d w_{i, j} \\, f_i(s) $$ The expected discounted probability of observing the feature $f_j$ in the future is defined as a weighted sum of the features of the state $s$. The value of a state is now defined as:\n$$ V^\\pi(s) = \\sum_{j=1}^d M_j(s) \\, r(f_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^d r(f_j) \\, \\sum_{i=1}^d w_{i, j} \\, f_i(s) $$ where $r(f_j)$ is the expected immediate reward when observing the feature $f_j$, what can be easily tracked as before. Computing the value of a state based on the SR now involves a double sum over a $d \\times d$ matrix, $d$ being the number of features, what should generally be much more tractable than over the total number of states squared.\nAs we use linear approximation, the learning rule for the weights $w_{i, j}$ becomes linearly dependent on the SPE:\n$$ \\delta^\\text{SR}_t(f_j) = f_j(s_t) + \\gamma \\, M_j(s_{t+1}) - M_j(s) $$ $$ \\Delta w_{i, j} = \\alpha \\, \\delta^\\text{SR}_t(f_j) \\, f_i(s_t) $$ The SPE tells us how surprising is each feature $f_j$ when being in the state $s_t$. This explains the term sensory prediction error: we are now not learning based on how surprising rewards are anymore, but on how surprising the sensory features of the outcome are. Did I expect that door to open at some point? Should this event happen soon? What kind of outcome is likely to happen? As the SPE is now a vector for all sensory features, we see why successor representation have a great potential: instead of a single scalar RPE dealing only with reward magnitudes, we now can learn from very diverse representations describing the various relevant dimensions of the task. It can then deal with different rewards: food and monetary rewards are treated the same by RPEs, while we can distinguish them with SPEs.\nThe main potential problem is of course to extract the relevant features for the task, either by hand-engineering them or through learning (one could work in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, for example). Feature-based state representations still have to be Markovian for SR to work. It is also possible to use non-linear function approximators such as deep networks (Kulkarni et al., 2016, Baretto et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2016, Machado et al., 2018, Ma et al., 2018), but this is out of the scope of this post.\n2.3 - Successor representations of actions The previous sections focused on the successor representation of states to obtain the value function $V^\\pi(s)$. The same idea can be applied to state-action pairs and their $Q^\\pi(s, a)$ values. The Q-value of a state action pair can be defined as:\n$$ Q^\\pi(s, a) = \\sum_{s', a'} M(s, a, s', a') \\, r(s', a') $$ where $r(s', a')$ is the expected immediate reward obtained after $(s', a')$ and $M(s, a, s', a')$ is the SR between the pairs $(s, a)$ and $(s', a')$ as in (Momennejad et al., 2017). Ducarouge and Sigaud (2017) use a SR representation between a state-action pair $(s, a)$ and a successor state $s'$:\n$$ Q^\\pi(s, a) = \\sum_{s'} M(s, a, s') \\, r(s') $$ In both cases, the SR can be learned using a sensory prediction error, such as:\n$$ \\delta^\\text{SR}_{s_t, a_t} = \\mathbb{I}(s_t = s') + \\gamma \\, M(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}, s') - M(s_t, a_t, s') $$  Note that eligibility traces can be used in SR learning as easily as in TD methods.\n3 - Successor representations in neuroscience 3.1 - Human goal-directed behavior So great, we now have a third form of reinforcement learning. Could it be the missing theory to explain human reinforcement learning and the dichotomy goal-directed behavior / habits?\nMomennejad et al. (2017) designed a two-steps sequential learning task with reward and transition revaluations. In the first learning phase, the subjects are presented with sequences of images (the states) and obtain different rewards (Fig. 1). The sequence $1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 5$ is rewarded with 10 dollars while the sequence $2 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 6$ is rewarded with 1 dollar only. Successful learning is tested by asking the participant whether he/she prefers the states 1 or 2 (the answer is obviously 1).\n Two-steps sequential learning task of Momennejad et al. (2017).   In the reward revaluation task, the transitions $3 \\rightarrow 5$ and $4 \\rightarrow 6$ are experienced again in the re-learning phase, but this time with reversed rewards (1 and 10 dollars respectively). In the transition revaluation task, the transitions $3 \\rightarrow 6$ and $4 \\rightarrow 5$ are now experienced, but the states $5$ and $6$ still receive the same amount of reward. The preference for $1$ or $2$ is again tested at the end of the re-learning phase ($2$ should now be preferred in both tasks) and a revaluation score is computed (how much the subject changes his preference between the two phases).\nWhat would the different ML methods predict?\n  Model-free methods would not change their preference in both conditions. The value of the $3 \\rightarrow 5$ and $4 \\rightarrow 6$ transitions (reward revaluation) or $3 \\rightarrow 6$ and $4 \\rightarrow 5$ (transition revaluation) would change during the re-learning phase, but the transitions $1 \\rightarrow 3$ and $2 \\rightarrow 4$ are never experienced again, so the value of the states $1$ and $2$ can only stay the same, even with eligibility traces.\n  Model-based methods would change their preference in both conditions. The reward and transition probabilities would both be re-learned completely to reflect the change, so the new value of $1$ and $2$ can be computed correctly using dynamic programming.\n  Successor representation methods would adapt to the reward revaluation ($r(s)$ will quickly fit the new reward distribution for the states $5$ and $6$), but not to the transition revaluation: $6$ is never a successor state of $1$ in the re-learning phase, so the SR matrix will not be updated for the states $1$ and $2$.\n  We have three different mechanisms with testable predictions on these two tasks: the human experiments should tell us which method is the best model of human RL. Well\u0026hellip; Not really.\n Revaluation score in the reward (red) and transition (blue) revaluation conditions for the model-free (MF), model-based (MB), successor representation (SR) and human data as reported in Momennejad et al. (2017).   Human participants show a revaluation behavior in the two conditions (reward and transition) somehow in between the model-based and successor representation algorithms. The difference between the reward and transition conditions is statistically significant, so unlike MB, but not as dramatic as for SR. The authors propose a hybrid SR-MB model, linearly combining the outputs of the MB and SR algorithms, and fit it to the human data to obtain a satisfying match. A second task requiring the model to actually take actions confirms this observation.\nIt is hard to conclude anything definitive from this model and the somehow artificial fit to the data. Reward revaluation was the typical test to distinguish between MB and MF processes, or between goal-directed behavior and habits. This paper suggests that transition revaluation (and policy revaluation, investigated in the second experiment) might allow distinguishing between MB and SR mechanisms, supporting the existence of SR mechanisms in the brain. How MB and SR might interact in the brain and whether there is an arbitration mechanism between the two is still an open issue. (Russek et al., 2017) has a very interesting discussion on the link between MF and MB processes in the brain, based on different versions of the SR.\n3.2 - Neural substrates of successor representations In addition to describing human behavior at the functional level, the SR might also allow to better understand the computations made by the areas involved in goal-directed behavior, in particular the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, the dopaminergic system, and the hippocampus. The key idea of Gershman and colleagues is that the SR $M(s, s')$ might be encoded in the place cells of the hippocampus (Stachenfeld et al., 2017), which are known to be critical for reward-based navigation. The sensory prediction error (SPE $\\delta^\\text{SR}_t$) might be encoded in the activation of the dopaminergic cells in VTA (or in a fronto-striatal network), driving learning of the SR in the hippocampus (Gardner et al., 2018), while the value of a state $V^\\pi(s) = \\sum_{s'} M(s, s') , r(s')$ could be computed either in the prefrontal cortex (ventromedial or orbitofrontal) or in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens in rats), ultimately allowing action selection in the dorsal BG.\nDopamine as a SPE The most striking prediction of the SR hypothesis is that the SPE is a vector of prediction errors, with one element per state (in the original formulation) or per reward feature (using linear function approximation, section 2.2). This contrasts with the classical RPE formulation, where dopaminergic activation is a single scalar signal driving reinforcement learning in the BG and prefrontal cortex. Although this would certainly be an advantage in terms of functionality and flexible learning, it remains to be shown whether VTA actually encodes such a feature-specific signal.\nNeurons in VTA have a rather uniform response to rewards or reward-predicting cues, encoding mostly the value of the outcome regardless its sensory features, except for those projecting to the tail of the striatum which mostly respond to threats and punishments (Watabe-Uchida and Uchida, 2019). The current state of knowledge seems to rule out VTA as a direct source of SPE signals.\nInterestingly, Oemisch et al. (2019) showed that feature-specific prediction errors signals (analogous to the SPE with linear approximation) are detected in the fronto-striatal network including the anterior cingulate area (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsal striatum and ventral striatum (VS) / nucleus accumbens (NAcc). These SPE-like signals appear shortly after non-specific RPE signals, first in ACC and then in the rest of the network. This suggests that SPE would actually be the result of a more complex calculation than proposed in the SR hypothesis, involving a network of interconnected areas. A detailed neuro-computational model of this network still has to be proposed.\nHippocampus as a predictive map Another interesting prediction of the SR hypothesis is that the hippocampus might be the site where the SR matrix is represented (Stachenfeld et al., 2017). In navigation tasks, the so-called place cells in the hippocampus exhibit roughly circular receptive fields centered on different locations in the environment (O\u0026rsquo;Keefe and Nadel, 1978). Altogether, place cells are thought to provide a sparse code of the animal\u0026rsquo;s location. Strikingly, place fields change with the environment: moving the animal from a circular to a rectangular environment, or introducing barriers, modifies the distribution of place fields. Additionally, grid cells in the entorhinal cortex (reciprocally connected to the hippocampus) show a hexagonal grid pattern of receptive fields, i.e. a single grid cell responds for several positions of the animal inside the environment (Hafting et al., 2005). Grid cells' receptive fields also depend on the environment and have been shown to depend on place cells, not the other way around. The mechanism behind the flexibility of place and grid fields is still to be understood.\nStachenfeld et al. (2017) propose that place cells actually encode the SR $M(s, s')$ between the current location $s$ and their preferred location $s'$, rather than simply an Euclidian distance between $s$ and $s'$ as classically used in hippocampal models. Because of the discount rate in the SR and its dependency on the animal\u0026rsquo;s policy, place fields are then roughly circular (exponentially decreasing) in an open environment, where the animal can theoretically reach any neighboring location from its current position. When constraints are added to the environment, such as walls and barriers, certain transitions are not possible anymore, which will modify the shape of the place fields. This fits with experimental observations, contrary to most models of place field formation using Gaussian receptive fields around fixed locations. Additionally, the SR hypothesis is in agreement with the observation that rewarded locations are represented by a higher number of place cells, as the animal spends more time around them.\n Place field on a linear track with an obstacle at x=1, using a Euclidian model (left) and the SR hypothesis (right). Adapted from Fig. 2 of (Stachenfeld et al., 2017).   Fig. 3 illustrates this prediction: if a rat is placed on a linear track with an obstacle, the place cell whose RF is centered on the obstacle would react identically on both sides of the obstacle using a Euclidian model, while it would only respond on the side it has explored using the SR. When the rat is put on the other side, the SRs would initially be 0 for that cell (but would grow with more exploration).\nStachenfeld et al. (2017) also propose a mechanism for grid cell formation in the entorhinal cortex. Grid cells are understood as a low-dimensional eigendecomposition of the SR place cells (dimensionality reduction, as in principal component analysis). This allows to explain why grid cells change in different environments (circular, rectangular or triangular), as experimentally observed. They also propose a mechanism for sub-goal formation using grid cells, but using the normalized min-cut algorithm, so quite far from being biologically realistic.\nDiscussion Successor representations are an interesting trade-off between model-free and model-based RL algorithms, explicitly separating state transitions from reward estimation. It allows reacting quickly to distal reward changes without the computational burden of completely model-based planning. Deep RL variants of SR (Kulkarni et al., 2016) obtain satisfying results on classical RL tasks such as Atari games and simulated robots, but are still outperformed by modern model-free algorithms. Similar to human behavior, hybrid architectures using both SR and MF methods might be able to combine the optimality of MF methods with the flexibility of the SR.\nAt the neuroscientific level, the SR hypothesis raises a lot of interesting questions, especially regarding the interplay between the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the basal ganglia during goal-directed behavior. Here are just a few aspects that need to be investigated both experimentally and theoretically:\n What is the relationship between the RPE and the SPE? Does VTA compute the SPE (still to be proven) and send it directly to the hippocampus through dopaminergic projections? Or does the RPE VTA somehow \u0026ldquo;train\u0026rdquo; ACC and PFC to compute the SPE, what is then sent to the hippocampus to update the SR representation? How? How does the hippocampus learn from SPE signals? The SR hypothesis still has to be linked with evidence on plasticity in the hippocampus. If dopamine does not carry the SPE, what is the role of the dopaminergic innervation of the hippocampus? The SR representation is in principle independent from rewards (except that animals may spend more time around reward location). How is the value of a state / action computed based on the SR representation in the hippocampus? Do sharp wave ripples (SWR, also called forward/inverse replays) actually sample the SR matrix (a list of achievable states from the current one), what is then integrated elsewhere (ventral striatum?) to guide behavior?

James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description.

However, recent reports of goals being overrepresented in sequential activity suggest a role in short-term planning, although a detailed understanding of the origins of hippocampal sequential activity and of its functional role is still lacking. In particular, it is unknown which mechanism could support efficient planning by generating place-cell sequences biased toward known goal locations, in an adaptive and constructive fashion. To address these questions, we propose a model of spatial learning and sequence generation as interdependent processes, integrating cortical contextual coding, synaptic plasticity and neuromodulatory mechanisms into a map-based approach. Following goal learning, sequential activity emerges from continuous attractor network dynamics biased by goal memory inputs. We apply Bayesian decoding on the resulting spike trains, allowing a direct comparison with experimental data. Simulations show that this model (1) explains the generation of never-experienced sequence trajectories in familiar environments, without requiring virtual self-motion signals, (2) accounts for the bias in place-cell sequences toward goal locations, (3) highlights their utility in flexible route planning, and (4) provides specific testable predictions.","tags":["computational neuroscience"],"title":"Predictive Place-Cell Sequences for Goal-Finding Emerge from Goal Memory and the Cognitive Map: A Computational Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Winfried Lötzsch","Julien Vitay","Fred H.

Policy gradient methods, such as stochastic policy gradient or deep deterministic policy gradient, propose to overcome this problem by allowing continuous action spaces. Despite their promises, they suffer from long training times as they need huge numbers of interactions to converge. In this paper, we investigate in how far a recent asynchronously parallel actor-critic approach, initially proposed to speed up discrete RL algorithms, could be used for the continuous control of robotic arms.

They are a promising solution to achieve a brain-like artificial intelligence that can compete with natural intelligence on realistic behaviors. A crucial property of intelligent behavior is motivation, defined as the incentive to interact with the world in order to achieve specific goals, either extrinsic (obtaining rewards such as food or money, or avoiding pain) or intrinsic (satisfying one's curiosity, fun). In the human brain, motivated or goal-directed behavior depends on a network of different structures, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia and the limbic system. Dopamine, a neuro-transmitter associated with reward processing, plays a central role in coordinating the activity of this network. It structures processing in high-level cognitive areas along a limbic-associative-motor gradient and impacts the learning capabilities of the whole system. In this habilitation thesis, I present biologically-constrained neuro-computational models which investigate the role of dopamine in visual object categorization and memory retrieval (Vitay and Hamker, 2008), reinforcement learning and action selection (Vitay and Hamker, 2010), the updating, learning and maintenance of working memory (Schroll, Vitay and Hamker, 2012) and timing processes (Vitay and Hamker, 2014). These models outline the many mechanisms by which the dopaminergic system regulates cognitive and emotional behavior: bistable processing modes in the cerebral cortex, modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity, allocation of cognitive resources and signaling of relevant events. Finally, I present a neural simulator able to simulate a variety of neuro-computational models efficiently on parallel architectures (Vitay, Dinkelbach and Hamker, 2015).","tags":[],"title":"On the role of dopamine in motivated behavior: a neuro-computational approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julien Vitay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475798400,"objectID":"1fc6ac98276866e5efc601fffb81aa00","permalink":"https://julien-vitay.net/publication/vitay2016/","publishdate":"2016-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vitay2016/","section":"publication","summary":"A reference implementation of: Laje, R. and Buonomano, D.V.

Receipt of a reward at the expected time allows to compute reward-prediction errors which can drive learning in motor or cognitive structures. Reciprocally, dopamine plays an important role in the timing of external events. Several models of the dopaminergic system exist, but the substrate of temporal learning is rather unclear. In this article, we propose a neuro-computational model of the afferent network to the ventral tegmental area, including the lateral hypothalamus, the pedunculopontine nucleus, the amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the ventral basal ganglia (including the nucleus accumbens and the ventral pallidum), as well as the lateral habenula and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. Based on a plausible connectivity and realistic learning rules, this neuro-computational model reproduces several experimental observations, such as the progressive cancelation of dopaminergic bursts at reward delivery, the appearance of bursts at the onset of reward-predicting cues or the influence of reward magnitude on activity in the amygdala and ventral tegmental area. While associative learning occurs primarily in the amygdala, learning of the temporal relationship between the cue and the associated reward is implemented as a dopamine-modulated coincidence detection mechanism in the nucleus accumbens.","tags":[],"title":"Timing and expectation of reward: a neuro-computational model of the afferents to the ventral tegmental area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Henning Schroll","Julien Vitay","Fred H.

These motor impairments have long been thought to result exclusively from immediate effects of dopamine loss on neuronal firing in basal ganglia, causing imbalances of basal ganglia pathways. However, motor impairments and pathway imbalances may also result from dysfunctional synaptic plasticity – a novel concept of how Parkinsonian symptoms evolve. Here we built a neuro-computational model that allows us to simulate the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity in basal ganglia. Our simulations confirm that dysfunctional synaptic plasticity can indeed explain the emergence of both motor impairments and pathway imbalances in Parkinson's disease, thus corroborating the novel concept. By predicting that dysfunctional plasticity results not only in reduced activation of desired responses, but also in their active inhibition, our simulations provide novel testable predictions. When simulating dopamine replacement therapy (which is a standard treatment in clinical practice), we observe a new balance of pathway outputs, rather than a simple restoration of non-Parkinsonian states. In addition, high doses of replacement are shown to result in overshooting motor activity, in line with empirical evidence. Finally, our simulations provide an explanation for the intensely debated paradox that focused basal ganglia lesions alleviate Parkinsonian symptoms, but do not impair performance in healthy animals. Overall, our simulations suggest that the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity play an essential role in the development of Parkinsonian symptoms, thus arguing for a re-conceptualisation of Parkinsonian pathophysiology.","tags":[],"title":"Dysfunctional and compensatory synaptic plasticity in Parkinson's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Helge Ü.

In this article, we aim at investigating the advantages and drawbacks of the CPU and GPU parallelization of mean-firing rate neurons, widely used in systems-level computational neuroscience. By comparing OpenMP, CUDA and OpenCL implementations towards a serial CPU implementation, we show that GPUs are better suited than CPUs for the simulation of very large networks, but that smaller networks would benefit more from an OpenMP implementation. As this performance strongly depends on data organization, we analyze the impact of various factors such as data structure, memory alignment and floating precision. We then discuss the suitability of the different hardware depending on the networks' size and connectivity, as random or sparse connectivities in mean-firing rate networks tend to break parallel performance on GPUs due to the violation of coalescence.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of GPU- and CPU-implementations of mean-firing rate neural networks on parallel hardware","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julien Vitay","Fred H.

This article first proposes an overview of the brain areas involved in the emotional modulation of behavior and suggests a functional architecture allowing to perform efficient decision making. It then reviews a series of biologically-inspired computational models of emotion dealing with behavioral tasks like classical conditioning and decision making, which highlight the computational mechanisms involved in emotional behavior. It underlines the importance of embodied cognition in artificial intelligence, as emotional processing is at the core of the cognitive computations deciding which behavior is more appropriate for the agent.

We suggest here to investigate the role of the basal ganglia (BG) in the learning of delayed rewarded tasks through the selective gating of thalamocortical loops. We designed a computational model of the visual loop linking the perirhinal cortex, the BG and the thalamus, biased by sustained representations in prefrontal cortex. This model learns concurrently different delayed rewarded tasks that require to maintain a visual cue and to associate it to itself or to another visual object to obtain reward. The retrieval of visual information is achieved through thalamic stimulation of the perirhinal cortex. The input structure of the BG, the striatum, learns to represent visual information based on its association to reward, while the output structure, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, learns to link striatal representations to the disinhibition of the correct thalamocortical loop. In parallel, a dopaminergic cell learns to associate striatal representations to reward and modulates learning of connections within the BG. The model provides testable predictions about the behavior of several areas during such tasks, while providing a new functional organization of learning within the BG, putting emphasis on the learning of the striatonigral connections as well as the lateral connections within the substantia nigra pars reticulata. It suggests that the learning of visual WM tasks is achieved rapidly in the BG and used as a teacher for feedback connections from prefrontal cortex to posterior cortices.","tags":[],"title":"A computational model of basal ganglia and its role in memory retrieval in rewarded visual memory tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julien Vitay","Jérémy Fix","Frederik Beuth","Henning Schroll","Fred H.

In particular, the basal ganglia has been proposed to implement among other things reinforcement learning for action selection, motor control or working memory. We discuss to which extent the analogy between the temporal difference algorithm and the firing of dopamine cells can be considered as valid.

We propose a computational model that focuses on the role of the perirhinal cortex in working memory, particularly with respect to sustained activities and memory retrieval. This model describes how different partial informations are integrated into assemblies of neurons that represent the identity of an object. Through dopaminergic modulation, the resulting clusters can retrieve the global information with recurrent interactions between neurons. Dopamine leads to sustained activities after stimulus disappearance that form the basis of the involvement of the perirhinal cortex in visual working memory processes. The information carried by a cluster can also be retrieved by a partial thalamic or prefrontal stimulation.

Contrary to a top-down approach necessitating to know an analytic expression of the function to be simulated, the chosen bottom-up approach allows to observe the emergence of a function thanks to the interaction of artificial neural populations without any prior knowledge. We first present a particular neural network type, neural fields, whose properties of robustness to noise and spatio-temporal continuity allow that emergence. In order to guide the emergence of sensorimotor transformations onto this substrate, we then present the architecture of the visual and motor systems to highlight the central role of visual attention in the realization of these functions by the brain. We then propose a functional diagram of sensorimotor transformations where the preparation of an ocular saccade guides attention towards a region of visual space and allow movement preparation. We last describe a computational model of attentional spotlight displacement that, by using a dynamical spatial working memory, allows sequential search of a target in a visual scene thanks to the phenomenon of inhibition of return. The performances of this model (robustness to noise, to object movement and to saccade execution) are analyzed in simulation and on a robotic platform.","tags":[],"title":"Emergence of sensorimotor functions on a numerical distributed neural substrate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jérémy Fix","Julien Vitay","Nicolas P.

Example for synfire chains:\nw = np.array([[None]*pre.size]*post.size) for i in range(post.size): w[i, (i-1)%pre.size] = 1.0 proj.connect_from_matrix(w) w = lil_matrix((pre.size, post.size)) for i in range(pre.size): w[pre.size, (i+1)%post.size] = 1.0 proj.connect_from_sparse(w)   Compiling and running the simulation Once all populations and projections are created, you have to generate to the C++ code and compile it:\ncompile()  You can now manipulate all parameters/variables from Python thanks to the Cython bindings.\nA simulation is simply run for a fixed duration with:\nsimulate(1000.) # 1 second  You can also run a simulation until a criteria is filled, check:\nhttps://annarchy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/Simulation.html#early-stopping\n Monitoring By default, a simulation is run in C++ without interaction with Python.\nYou may want to record some variables (neural or synaptic) during the simulation with a Monitor:\nm = Monitor(pop, ['v', 'r']) n = Monitor(proj, ['w'])  After the simulation, you can retrieve the recordings with:\nrecorded_v = m.get('v') recorded_r = m.get('r') recorded_w = n.get('w')  Warning: calling get() flushes the array.\nWarning: recording projections can quickly fill up the RAM (see Dendrites).\n Example 1: Echo-State Network Link to the Jupyter notebook on github: RC.ipynb\n 2 - Spiking networks  Spiking neurons Spiking neurons must also define two additional fields:\n  spike: condition for emitting a spike.\n  reset: what happens after a spike is emitted (at the start of the refractory period).\n  A refractory period in ms can also be specified.\nExample of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire:\nLIF = Neuron( parameters=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; tau = 20.
